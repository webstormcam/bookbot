# bookbot
BookBot is a text analyis tool. It will tell you how many words are in the text as well as how many individual characters. 

I had it go through the frankenstien story but you can download and put in any text you want! 

This is not a mind blowing project but I hope to build more. 

Thanks Boot.dev for helping me understand everything up till now :)
